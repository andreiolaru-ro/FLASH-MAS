/**
 * Testing for HPC capabilities.

 * This has been heavily modified from the initial implementation of Andrada, because the <code>run()</code> method has
 * been eliminated from Entity and placed into {@link net.xqhs.flash.core.RunnableEntity}. It may be that some classes
 * may have needed to be shifted to implement {@link net.xqhs.flash.core.RunnableEntity}.
 * <p>
 * Therefore, it may be that none of these simulations run or run as intended.
