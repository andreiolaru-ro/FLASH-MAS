# FLASH-MAS
The Fast Lightweight Agent Shell MAS framework

*Easy for beginners, powerful to experts*

FLASH-MAS implements a model based on generic *entities*, which could be agents, agent groups, nodes, communication infrastructure elements, or agent components.

FLASH-MAS is supposed to become compatible with other models and infrastructures, such as JADE or JaCaMo, and be a vlid choice for ABMS simulations, by modularizing infrastructure services so that agents don't need code changes when changing communication or deployment infrastructure.
