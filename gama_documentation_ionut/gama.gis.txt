Install GAMA. Then:

Gama uses .gaml files to define models.

1. gama.core: Contains the core spatial topology and geometry handling.
https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/tree/main/gama.core/src/gama/core/common/geometry

2. gama.extension.traffic: Source code for the complex traffic simulation skills.
https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/main/gama.extension.traffic/models/Driving%20Skill/models/Advanced%20models/Drive%20Random.gaml

3. msi.gama.ext: Often contains the connectors to external GIS libraries like GeoTools.

4. GAMAFile class or ShapeFile implementations to see how the data is parsed internally.

I. The above are on this link: https://github.com/gama-platform/gama

II. I need to read: https://gama-platform.org/wiki/RoadTrafficModel_step1

the GAMA application's "Models Library" view.
Here is the Tutorials/3D/Road Traffic/Models/Model7.gaml file
