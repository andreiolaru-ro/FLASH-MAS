/**
 * A wrapper class for streamlining ROS Topic publishing. Note that the {@link #advertise()} never *needs* to be explicitly
 * called. If you use the standard {@link #Publisher(String, String, RosBridge)} method, it will be automatically
 * called on construction and if you use the {@link #Publisher(String, String, RosBridge, boolean)} method
 * and set the advertiseNow flag to false, you still don't *need* to call it, because the first publish will
 * automatically make sure the topic has been advertised first.
 * <p>
 * Publish messages using the {@link #publish(Object)} method. It takes an object containing the ROS message
 * to publish. Generally, the msg should either be a Javabean, such as one of the pre-included
 * messages in the {@link ros.msgs} package that has the same field structure as the target topic type
 * or a {@link java.util.Map} object
 * representing the ROS message type structure. For
 * example, if the ROS message type is "std_msgs/String" then msg should be a {@link ros.msgs.std_msgs.PrimitiveMsg}
 * with the generic of String, or a Map object
 * with one Map key-value entry of "data: stringValue" where stringValue is whatever the "std_msgs/String"
 * data field value is.
