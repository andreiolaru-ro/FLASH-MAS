    Shadow Protocol - work in progress

Components:
    - ShadowHomeServer = central server that knows the location of the agent and its shadow (websocket server)
    - ShadowHost = shadow components (its a web socket client that communicates with the ShadowHomeServer)
    - ShadowProxy = it is created by the agent if the agent decide to migrate (contains the next destination of the agent)
    - ShadowPylon = manages all the components that are on the machine
    - ShadowAgent = shards

Flow for the components created on a machine:
   - pylon is created
        - pylon checks if the homeServer it is up, if not starts the homeServer
   - Agent is created => with the messaging shard ShadowAgent
   - The shard created checks if it has a shadow
        - if not, creates the shadow => that it is the websocket client and connects to the server
