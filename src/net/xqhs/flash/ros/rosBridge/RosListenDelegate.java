/**
 * This is a delegate interface for handling ros topic subscriptions. The {@link #receive(com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode, String)}
 * is called every time the topic with which this delegate is associated has a new message published.
 * The JSON data, given as a {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}, has four top-level fields:<p>
 * op: what kind of operation it was; should always be "publish"<p>
 * topic: to which topic the message was published<p>
 * type: the ROS message type of the topic<p>
 * msg: the provided ros message in JSON format. This the primary field you will work with.<p>
 * There are generally two ways you can parse the message into a more usable Java object. The first involves manually
 * iterating through the JSON fields of the msg. For example,
 * for a geometry_msgs/Twist message, you can get out the linear x value as follows:<p>
 * <code>double x = data.get("msg").get("linear").get("x").asDouble();</code><p>
 * (If an element is na array, JSON methods exist for handling it such as {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode#get(int)}
 * and {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode#size()}). The the other way is to let the Jackson library unpack
 * it into a JavaBean. The {@link ros.tools.MessageUnpacker} class further streamlines this process. See its documentation
 * for more information.
